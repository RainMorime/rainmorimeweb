# CONTACT Section Modifications Summary

This rule summarizes the key changes and features implemented in the CONTACT section based on our recent conversation, primarily affecting `[pages/index.js](mdc:pages/index.js)` and `[styles/Home.module.scss](mdc:styles/Home.module.scss)`.

## Conceptual Framework

*   The CONTACT section was redesigned based on the "Signal Tower" / "RAINMORIME Data Interface" concept from `[Story.txt](mdc:.cursor/rules/Story.txt)`.
*   It aims to represent the "守林人" attempting to transmit data or signals in a post-apocalyptic setting.

## Key Features Implemented

1.  **Radar Display:**
    *   A circular radar element (`.radarDisplay`) was added, positioned towards the right of the section.
    *   It includes a rotating scanner effect (`.scanner`) using `conic-gradient`.
        *   The scanner color changes from green to pink/purple in the `.inverted` state.
        *   Rotation direction is reversed.
    *   An animated grid background (`::before`, `::after` with `repeating-linear-gradient` and `moveGrid` animation) was added inside the radar.
    *   Multiple ripple effects were added:
        *   One simplified central ripple (`.ripple1` using `contactRippleExpandShadow`).
        *   Three smaller ripples originating from different points (`.smallRipple1` to `.smallRipple3` using `contactRippleExpandShadowSmall`).
    *   In the `.inverted` state, all ripples are hidden (`opacity: 0; animation: none;`).

2.  **Contact Information Integration:**
    *   The user's contact details (Email, GitHub, Bilibili) are presented as interactive icons positioned outside the radar circle but within the Contact section (`.logItem`, `.radarContact1` to `.radarContact3`).
    *   Icons (`.logIcon`) are displayed within background squares (`.logIconContainer`).
    *   The Bilibili icon uses an inline SVG from `[public/pictures/bilibili-svgrepo-com.svg](mdc:public/pictures/bilibili-svgrepo-com.svg)` to ensure proper styling.
    *   Each icon has a dedicated, continuous ripple effect originating from its center (`.contactIconRipple`).
        *   The ripple animation (`contactRippleExpandShadow`) was adjusted for visibility.
        *   In the `.inverted` state, these icon ripples are hidden.

3.  **Email Interaction:**
    *   The email item is implemented as a `<button>`.
    *   Clicking the button copies the email address (`rainmorime@qq.com`) to the clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText` (`handleCopyEmail` function in `[pages/index.js](mdc:pages/index.js)`).
    *   A "Copied!" feedback message (`.copyFeedback`) appears briefly above the icon after copying, using a float-up-fade-out animation (`floatUpFadeOut`).
    *   Hovering over the email button reveals the full email address (`.emailText`) sliding in from the right.

4.  **Styling and Layout:**
    *   The overall layout uses absolute positioning for the contact icons relative to the `.contactSection`.
    *   The `CONTACT` section has a background image (`[public/pictures/h.png](mdc:public/pictures/h.png)`) applied, positioned towards the bottom (`background-position: center 300px`).
    *   A negative `margin-bottom` was added to `.contactSection` to create an overlap with the `.aboutSection` below it.
    *   The `EXPERIENCE` section (`.experienceSection`) had its `min-height` set to `auto` and `padding-bottom` reduced to minimize empty space.
    *   The content slide-in animation duration (`slideInFromRight`, `slideOutToRight`) for `.contentWrapper` was increased.

Refer to `[pages/index.js](mdc:pages/index.js)` for the component structure and JavaScript logic, and `[styles/Home.module.scss](mdc:styles/Home.module.scss)` for detailed CSS rules and animations.
